TODO
----
x Create GitHub repo
x Add README to repo
x Copy library code across from React app and get it building as a library
x Add library code to repo
x Add demo agent implementations
x Re-work React-based demo app as a vanilla JavaScript demo app
x Add demo app
x Add demo container
x Update library code to remove Webpack magic comment in dynamic import() expression
x Update demo app code to add uncomment about exceptions being swallowed by inline script type="module"
x Publish library as an npm package
x Test installing and using published npm package in React-based demo app
x Test installing published npm package on separate machine
x Update library code to reinstate Webpack magic comment in dynamic import() expression
x Update README with instructions on how to run the demo app
x Update README to explain about demo app and recommendation for how to play around with it
x Update README to split Overview into Overview and Background
x Update README to recommend container over app for config source and discovery strategy
x Investigate problem with JS errors being swallowed by inline script type="module" code in demo app - either fix this, or convert demo app to use a framework/bundler which avoids this problem
x Fix issue with apparently no error thrown on non-match of provider during discovery phase (actually this is almost certainly just because of the script type="module" issue above)
x Update README with screenshot of demo app

 Proof-read README and update as necessary
 Add new section to README - 'Steps to replace hard-coded agent with use of fdc3-installer'
 Add to FAQ - How does provider version matching work in the discovery phase?
 Update README with diagram showing the overall problem that the library is trying to solve
 Update README with diagram showing how fdc3-installer works

 Look at issue with errors being surfaced as promise rejections - it appears this was actually the root cause of the error swallowing previously seen in the demo app with the inline script type="module" code
 Add additional validation in library's installAgent() method e.g. check that providerDef.providerImplementation is truthy
 Review use of the phrase 'FDC3 Agent' throughout the codebase
 Test library again with InstallerConfigSource.App
 Test creation strategy executors again with passing multiple args to function / constructor / methods

 Consider updating the GitHub repo description to something longer
 Look at what open source license should be used for the repo

 Consider the issue of dynamic (rather than just static) function / constructor method args
