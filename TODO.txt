-----


Removed Webpack magic comment (/* webpackIgnore: true */) from dynamic import expression() in fdc3Installer.installAgent() method. This was required when this code was originally built inside a CRA-based React application, but is redundant now that fdc3-installer is a standalone library built with TSDX.
